        <p>Hi there! I’m @anakhavaishakham2005, your go-to multitasker for all things coding, creating, and casually thriving under pressure. From sketching masterpieces to coding magic, I’m proof that you can do it all (with a touch of chaos)! 🎩</p>
        <p>Fun fact? Deadlines are my caffeine—I don’t just meet them; I high-five them on the way out. 🚀 Life’s a rollercoaster, and I’m riding it hands-free!

        <header>Coding & Creativity Go Hand in Hand 💻🎨</header>
        <p>By day, I’m a Computer Science student mastering the art of code (and occasionally battling semicolons). By night, I’m an artist bringing ideas to life with nothing but a pencil and determination. ✏️
        </p>
        <p>Coding and art aren’t so different—they both need patience, logic, and a little bit of flair. Whether it’s debugging an error or adding the perfect stroke to a sketch, I’ve got it covered.

        <p>Here’s a sneak peek into the quirks that make me, me:        </p>
        <p>I'm totally being honest here...(JFYI😉)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google’s Bestie🫂: If Googling errors were an Olympic sport, I’d have a gold medal. 🥇</li>
            <li>Emoji Queen💃: I can turn any conversation into an emoji-filled masterpiece. 🤩</li>
            <li>Debugger Extraordinaire👩‍💻: I don’t just fix bugs; I form deep, philosophical bonds with them before sending them off. 🐛✨</li>
            <li>Stress Junkie😉: Give me a calm day, and I’ll find something stressful to make it fun. 😎</li>
            <li>Typo Pro🧐: I can spot a typo whether its mine or others from a mile away. It’s like a superpower. 🤓So let me be specific, my bugs are not typos... they are just a little creative freedom. 😜</li>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Fourth">
        <header>Thriving in Organized Chaos 🌪️</header>
        <p>I’m at my best when the world around me feels like a whirlwind. Assignments due tomorrow? Hackathon prep in a week? No problem! I take life one chaotic step at a time and still manage to come out smiling. 🌈            </p>
        <p>Dehydration, exam stress, or sleepless nights? They don’t stand a chance when I’m on a roll. </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Fifth">
        <header>Dreaming Big, One Step at a Time 🌟</header>
        <p>The journey is just as exciting as the destination, and I’m enjoying every bit of it. From learning Flutter and Python to gearing up for my next hackathon, I’m all about growth. 🎓</p>
        <p>One day, I’ll be that software developer who writes clean code and inspires others to aim high. Until then, I’m coding, sketching, and living my best life in the most fun way possible! 💪</p>
